# Grid Demo

The grid demo is used to inspect the grid system visually. It lays columns over
the page so pages are easy debuggable. The `grid-demo` component should be used
at a layouts level.

## Usage

```html
<grid-demo :show="false" />
```

## Props

* `show`: (Boolean) - shows or hides the grid
